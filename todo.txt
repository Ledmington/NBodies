Add a simple GUI menu when starting that lets you choose:
 - number of bodies
 - number of steps
 - delta time
 - friction constant
 - other simulation data

Add FPS counter in the GUI

Measure computation time of each frame and show: min, max and avg

Compute and show total sum of velocities (to see if the simulation is converging or not)

Knowing total number of steps and "current" execution time, compute and show ETA
